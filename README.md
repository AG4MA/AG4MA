# Software Engineering · Systems Design · AI & Automation  

I work across engineering, automation, financial systems, and applied AI/ML.  
My focus is building reliable structures, analysing behaviour through data,  
and designing systems that scale in real-world environments.

# 🚀 Projects  

### 🧠 Bimodal Cognitive Transformer — *Side Project*  
Experimental architecture combining a reflective and a reactive cognitive model  
to study how coherent patterns and intention can emerge in artificial systems.

---

### 🛰️ UDRS — Urban Drone Response System — *Side Project*  
Autonomous modular response system for dense urban environments.  
Provides:  
- real-time situational analysis  
- remote support for responders  
- proactive safety mechanisms  
- micro-medical logistics  
- non-lethal intervention options  

Concept: **Urban Neural Layer** —  
a sensory-operational layer that anticipates human intervention  
and compresses critical reaction times.

### 📡 Behavioural & Decision Systems  
Models and tools for analysing behavioural patterns,  
data-driven decision processes,  
and early-warning signals in complex environments.

## 📐 Principles  

- Keep systems clean and predictable  
- Structure first, implementation second  
- Clarity over complexity  
- Technology as support, not replacement
