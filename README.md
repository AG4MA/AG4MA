# Software Engineering · Systems Design · AI & Automation  

I work across engineering, automation, financial systems, and applied AI/ML.  
My focus is building reliable structures, analysing behaviour through data,  
and designing systems that scale in real-world environments.

# 🚀 Projects  

## 🧠 Bimodal Cognitive Transformer — *Side Project*  
Experimental framework exploring a dual-mode architecture:  
a reflective model and a reactive model interacting to produce coherent behaviour.  
Goal: studying how decision patterns and intention emerge in artificial systems.

---

## 🛰️ UDRS — Urban Drone Response System  
Modular emergency-response platform based on autonomous drones.  
Provides:  
- real-time analysis  
- remote support for responders  
- proactive prevention  
- micro-medical logistics  
- non-lethal intervention  

Key concept: the **Urban Neural Layer**,  
a sensory-operational layer that anticipates human response  
and reduces critical reaction times.

---

## 📡 Behavioural & Decision Systems  
Tools and models for analysing collective patterns,  
data-driven decision processes,  
and early-warning signals in complex environments.

# 📐 Principles  

- Keep systems clean and predictable  
- Structure first, implementation second  
- Clarity over complexity  
- Technology as support, not replacement
